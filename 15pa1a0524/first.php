    <p><i>AMARAVATI:</i> In a major blow for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Friday formally decided to quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), days after two of its ministers quit the Narendra Modi government protesting for Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh. The party will also move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government over the injustice meted out to the state, an official communique said.
            Union ministers -- P Ashok Gajapati Raju and YS Chowdary -- had quit on March 08 after a meeting with the Prime Minister over the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. The TDP politburo unanimously took the decision during a teleconference with party supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu this morning.
            Here are the updates:

                        Congress will also support the motion.
                        Another blow for the BJP as AIADMK is set to support the motion.

        <p>After <strong>Saina Nehwal</strong> became the first Indian shuttler to be eliminated from the All England Open Badminton Championships,
             Kidambi Srikanth also faced exit in the second round, while PV Sindhu and HS Prannoy prevailed with contrasting performances.
             Third seed Srikanth lost his pre-quarterfinal to match to the hands of Huang Yuxiang of China, who Prannoy will face in the last 8. 
             Other than Srikanth, India’s men’s doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty also failed to progress.
         Srikanth took time to get going against Yuxiang and found himself trailing 5-11 at break of the opening game. 
         Failing to recover from there, Srikanth 11-21 in just 12 minutes before bouncing back to take 6-1 lead in the second game and subsequently, went on to win 21-15. The decider was a closely-fought encounter and the scoreboard read 11-10 at break, with the Chinese in lead. Srikanth gave his best from there on but couldn't prevent Yuziang from taking the game 22-20.
    16th-ranked Prannoy faced a rather comfortable win, outscoring Tommy Sugiarto 21-10, 21-19 in the second round to ensure himself a place in the quarter-finals. After winning the first game in dominant fashion</p>
